# OpsMx Argo Rollouts Plugin

Argo Rollouts plugin implementation by [OpsMx](https://www.opsmx.com) for the logs and metrics analysis. 

OpsMx's [ISD](https://www.opsmx.com/intelligent-software-delivery-isd/isd-for-argo/) supports [40+ different CI/CD tools chains](https://www.opsmx.com/integrations) so one can integrate and observe logs and metrics from them and make effective decisions. It intelligently predicts and estimates possible build risks by applying Machine Learning to your CI/CD process. It can automatically verify a release in early-stages and identifies any regressions, anomalies, or failures that may have been introduced.
